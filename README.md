# BayesComp

 The project develops a PyTorch extension library for bayessian inference and parameter pruning in deep learning models.

## Theoretical background

...

## How to use?

Currently we support only linear layers. Take a look at 
[awesome repo](https://github.com/gpauloski/kfac-pytorch?tab=readme-ov-file), which supports convolutional and transformers layers.

## Installation
