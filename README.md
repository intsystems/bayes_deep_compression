# BayesComp

 The project develops a PyTorch extension library for bayessian inference and parameter pruning in deep learning models.

## Theoretical background

...

## How to use?

Currently we support only linear layers. Take a look at 
[awesome repo](https://github.com/gpauloski/kfac-pytorch?tab=readme-ov-file), which supports convolutional and transformers layers.

## Installation

...

## Development

Formidable copypaste of [repo](https://github.com/JavierAntoran/Bayesian-Neural-Networks) phonying to be in touch with current meta techstack.

Use Makefile for 
1) Development environment installation:
```
    make install-env
```
2) Formating:
```
    make format
``` 
3) Running tets:
```
    make tests
```
